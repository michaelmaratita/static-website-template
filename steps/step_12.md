# Lessons Learned/ Clean Up

Deploying my portfolio site with Terraform was an enriching experience. It allowed me to craft the architecture precisely as I envisioned it. Each resource deployment deepened my understanding of the services I employed, many of which were new to me. Navigating through Terraform to establish this infrastructure was a rewarding journey.

Moreover, this endeavor expanded my expertise in front-end development. Despite my limited familiarity with CSS and JavaScript, I gained confidence in coding precisely what I wanted and presenting that to the end user. Overcoming challenges, such as mastering the JavaScript fetch function to interact with the API Gateway, was a significant milestone that took a couple of days of troubleshooting after my real work day. When I finally cracked it, the sense of accomplishment was palpable.

In summary, I'm proud of what I've achieved and hope that others can leverage my experience for similar deployments.
